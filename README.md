# twoparter
New content type to provide info in two parts, for example a joke.

Each node will have two fields for content with accompanying fields to allow for
timing info.

The purpose of this content is to provide the first part in the morning and the
second part later in the day in an attempt to get the user coming back regularly
to view the entire node.

For example, a two-parter could start with:

*"What do you get when you cross a mentally ill man with a system that doesn't care?"*

...and the second half would be:

*"You get what you deserve!!"*

Alternatively you could use morning and afternoon daily devotionals or "thoughts for the day".

These fragments can be delivered via an RSS feed or in a block with options to show
both at once or the second one after a certain time.
